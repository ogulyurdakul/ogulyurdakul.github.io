<!-- In this paper, I propose a feature extraction technique based on Local Binary Pattern method, which assigns a binary code to each entry of a matrix based on its 8 surrounding entries. The method was first proposed for images, and was then adapted for 1D signals by taking an equal number of entries on each side of the center point.  -->
