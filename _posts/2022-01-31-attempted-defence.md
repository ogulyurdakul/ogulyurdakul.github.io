    <h1>1. Introduction</h1>
</div>

The functionalist conception of the human mind models it as a set of states characterized by causal roles, where each state can be caused by sensations and cause behaviour, as well as play a causal role in the activation of other states (Kim, 2011). The cross-wired brain thought experiment challenges functionalism by claiming it fails to account for the qualia of mental processes: A patient, with both the inputs and outputs to, say, the itch and pain subunits of their brain switched, would behave appropriately upon relative input but supposedly would experience the qualia of the wrong phenomenon. In this essay, I offer a way out of this challenge within the functionalist framework. Firstly in Section 2, I present the thought experiment and take a close look at the methodological aspects, then expose the faults in the line of thinking of the experiment. In Section 3 I present my solution to the challenge posed by the experiment, with its properties and their motivations. Finally, in Section 4, I summarize my ideas and criticize them myself.

## 2.1. The Crazy Neurosurgeon

I take the thought experiment as it is presented by Kim (2011). The story goes as follows: Suppose I am abducted in my sleep by a crazy neurosurgeon who wishes to perform a complex and sinister operation on my brain. The neurosurgeon is an expert of all neural circuitry in the brain, able to localize any sort of neural circuitry that implement various aspects of human psychology, in this case, the pain and itch sensations. The neurosurgeon identifies the neural circuits that implement these two operations and switches both their inputs and outputs and they proceed to patch me up perfectly fine with my newly rewired brain and relocate me to my bed.

Before we proceed further, let's take a look at some crude schematics of the relevant neural circuitry of my brain, as shown in Figure 1. Originally, the relative sensory inputs go to their relative neural circuits and through their computations cause appropriate behavioural output, as depicted in Figure 1a. After the operation because both the inputs and the outputs are crossed as shown in Figure 1b. The inputs cause the wrong neural circuit to activate, but these activations still cause appropriate behaviour.* From here on, I will use the terms neural circuits that implement various functional states as boxes for simplicity just like Kim: The pain receptors trigger the Pain Box which produces pain behaviour, and vice versa. The terms "neural circuit" and "box" wil be used interchangeably.

Now, what happens when I wake up in the morning and hit my pinky toe to the side of my bed frame? Following the schematic in Figure 1b, I would act appropriately on the outside: Most likely curse and start jumping on one leg. How about on the inside? What would be my subjective experience with my post-operation brain?

This is the main point of challenge for the thought experiment, as it creates a version of the inverted qualia problem (Kim, 2011). Prima facie, one would say that I would be experiencing the itchiness of an itch when I hit my pink toe, and conversely that I would experience the painfulness of a pain when my friend pranks me with itch powder. Functionalism seems to fail to give a satisfactory account for such an inversion of qualia or even (in an other line of thinking) lack thereof.


## 2.2. The Neurosurgeon's Methodology

On a tangent, let's take a closer look at how the neurosurgeon's method during the operation. At first glance, we may believe that the neurosurgeon would follow the causal chain forwards from the inputs on: Trace the pain receptors and the intermediary neurons they trigger, and the neurons that they trigger and so on. It is clear that such a tracing would be fruitless. Even if the neurosurgeon encounters the neural circuitry that implements, say, the pain mental state and eventually its output behaviour, they would be unable to isolate them from other neural circuitry dur to the immense connectivity of the human brain. The result of such a forward causal tracing would most likely yield a significant portion of the human brain as these neurons have the potential to trigger many other neurons, most of which most likely not significantly relevant to pain (or any other function we are interested in), if at all. So, asking "Which neurons can these pain receptors eventually fire?" is not sufficient in determining the neural circuitry that is the Pain Box. Let's call this first question as Q1.

What may be a solution to this? I say the neurosurgeon must follow a second, *backwards* causal route as well. Starting from the outputs, which are the appropriate motor neurons, the neurosurgeon follows the causal network (on its implementation, that is) in the backwards direction. This analysis yields all the neural circuitry that has the potential to cause such behaviour, so the question this time becomes "Which neurons can eventually cause these motor neurons to fire?" Let's call this question Q2. Similarly to the forwards tracing case, this analysis would point to an immensely large section of the human nervous system. But this time, the neurosurgeon also has the forwards tracing data. Intersecting the two sets of neurons yielded by the two questions and effectively asking "Which neurons fire due to the firing of these pain receptors and cause these motor neurons to  ire?", the candidate neurons would be to those linking the pain receptors to the lying on a directed path from the appropriate inputs, to the appropriate output, reducing their numbers.
