# 1. Introduction

The functionalist conception of the human mind models it as a set of states characterized by causal roles, where each state can be caused by sensations and cause behaviour, as well as play a causal role in the activation of other states (Kim, 2011). The cross-wired brain thought experiment challenges functionalism by claiming it fails to account for the qualia of mental processes: A patient, with both the inputs and outputs to, say, the itch and pain subunits of their brain switched, would behave appropriately upon relative input but supposedly would experience the qualia of the wrong phenomenon. In this essay, I offer a way out of this challenge within the functionalist framework. Firstly in Section 2, I present the thought experiment and take a close look at the methodological aspects. Then in Section 2.c, I expose the faults in the line of thinking of the experiment. In Section 3 I present my solution to the challenge posed by the experiment, with its properties and their motivations. Finally, in Section 4, I summarize my ideas and criticize them myself.

# 2. The Experiement

I take the thought experiment as it is presented by Kim (2011). The story goes as follows: Suppose I am abducted in my sleep by a crazy neurosurgeon who wishes to perform a complex and sinister
operation on my brain. The neurosurgeon is an expert of all neural circuitry in the brain, able to localize any sort of neural circuitry that implement various aspects of human psychology, in this case,
the pain and itch sensations. The neurosurgeon identifies the neural circuits that implement these two operations and switches both their inputs and outputs and they proceed to patch me up perfectly fine
with my newly rewired brain and relocate me to my bed.

Before we proceed further, let's take a look at some crude schematics of the relevant neural circuitry of my brain, as shown in Figure 1. Originally, the relative sensory inputs go to their relative neural circuits and through their computations cause appropriate behavioural output, as depicted in Figure 1a. After the operation because both the inputs and the outputs are crossed as shown in Figure 1b. The inputs cause the wrong neural circuit to activate, but these activations still cause appropriate behaviour.* From here on, I will use the terms neural circuits that implement various functional states as boxes for simplicity just like Kim: The pain receptors trigger the Pain Box which produces pain behaviour, and vice versa. The terms "neural circuit" and "box" wil be used interchangeably.
