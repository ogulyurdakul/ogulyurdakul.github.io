## Introduction

There is this possibility that I find intriguing regarding the explanatory power a scientific theory holds on the problems regarding the human mind-brain. I think I can say without any citation or reference that we do not currently have a theory that can provide a unanimously satisfactory account of various aspects of interest such as consciousness, let alone a comprehensive one. Many theories exist each with their own strengths and deficits, but not one (as far as I am aware) that roots --

To best illustrate the possibility that I am entertaining, I would first like to tell two stories, one about one of the most elementary results in analysis that a mathematics undergrad student learns and one of my own concoction, about two curious assistants of stage magic. I hope to then use these two as a base in telling a third story that entertains a certain possibility. But before I start, I would like to stress one thing: This is not me making any claims regarding the current state of consciousness science/neuroscience/even science in general, nor me coming to philosophical conclusions regarding the epistemic accessibility of the questions regarding the human mind-brain. I just aim to throw some *what-if*s because I think the possibility is entertaining to, well, entertain.

## Three Stories of Incompleteness

### Of Rational Numbers

In the field of mathematics called analysis, a frequently encountered question is convergence. It provides the answer to the famous seemingly confusing problem of whether $1 = 0.\bar 9$.
