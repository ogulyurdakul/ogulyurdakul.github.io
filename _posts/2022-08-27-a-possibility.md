## Introduction

There is this possibility that I find intriguing regarding the explanatory power a scientific models holds on the problems regarding the human mind-brain. I think I can say without any citation or reference that we do not currently have a theory that can provide a unanimously satisfactory account of various aspects of interest such as consciousness, let alone a comprehensive one. Many theories and models exist each with their own strengths and deficits<sup><a id="footnotemark1" href="/whatnot/2022/a_scenario_of_incompleteness/#footnotetext1">1</a></sup>, but not one (as far as I am aware) that roots --

To best illustrate the possibility that I am entertaining, I would first like to tell two stories, one about one of the most elementary results in analysis that a mathematics undergrad student learns and one of my own concoction, about two curious assistants of stage magic. I hope to then use these two as a base in telling a third story that entertains a certain possibility. But before I start, I would like to stress one thing: This is not me making any claims regarding the current state of consciousness science/neuroscience/even science in general, nor me coming to philosophical conclusions regarding the epistemic accessibility of the questions regarding the human mind-brain. I just aim to throw some *what-if*s because I think the possibility is entertaining to, well, entertain.

## Three Stories of Incompleteness

### Of Rational Numbers

In the field of mathematics called analysis, a frequently encountered question is convergence. It provides the answer to the famous seemingly confusing problem of whether $1 = 0.\bar 9$ (and let's try to settle that discussion, too, while we're at it). What is meant by $0. \bar 9$ is actually the following sum: 
$$
0. \bar 9 = \sum_{i = 1}^\infty \frac{9}{10^i}
$$
The problematic part of this expression is the infinity: How do you sum infinitely many numbers? What does that even mean? Had it been a *finite* sum, then we would be all good, everything would be well defined, so let's try building a solution on top of them. We construct a partial sums series, given as follows:
$$
S_n = \sum_{i = 1}^n \frac{9}{10^i}
$$
The elements of this sequence are all well defined, going $0.9$, $0.99$, $0.999$, $0.9999$ and so on. Furthermore to our luck, they can also be expressed analytically in another form with some algebraic manipulations through the geometric sum formula:
$$
S_n = \sum_{i = 1}^n \frac{9}{10^i} = \frac{9}{10} \sum_{i = 0}^{n-1} \frac{1}{10^i} = \frac{9}{10} \frac{1 - \frac{1}{10^n}}{1 - \frac{1}{10}}
$$
