Welcome to Whatnot, a blog where I write about whatnot (or plan to)! So far it mostly constitutes of various essays and projects I prepared for the courses I have previously taken, but I intend to share some non-course-material in time. The content are mostly on <a href="/whatnot/tags/#philosophy-of-mind">philosophy of mind</a> and <a href="/whatnot/tags/#cognitive-science">cognitive science</a>, although I intend to share more on <a href="/whatnot/tags/#aikido">aikido</a> and <a href="/whatnot/tags/#engineering">engineering</a>.
