Welcome to Whatnot, a blog where I write about whatnot (or plan to)! So far it mostly constitutes of various essays and projects I prepared for the courses I have previously taken, but I intend to share some non-course-material in time. The topics include 

{% include base_path %}
{% capture written_year %}'None'{% endcapture %}
{% for post in site.posts %}
  {% capture year %}{{ post.date | date: '%Y' }}{% endcapture %}
  {% if year != written_year %}
    <h2 id="{{ year | slugify }}" class="archive__subtitle">{{ year }}</h2>
    {% capture written_year %}{{ year }}{% endcapture %}
  {% endif %}
  {% include archive-single.html %}
{% endfor %}
