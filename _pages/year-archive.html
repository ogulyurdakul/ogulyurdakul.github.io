Welcome to Whatnot, a blog where I write about whatnot (or plan to)! So far it mostly constitutes of various essays and projects I prepared for the courses I have previously taken, but I intend to share some non-course-material in time. The content are mostly on [philosophy of mind](/whatnot/tags/#philosophy-of-mind) and [cognitive science](/whatnot/tags/#cognitive-science), although I intend to share more on [aikido](/whatnot/tags/#aikido) and [engineering](/whatnot/tags/#engineering).
