## Professional Experience

<ins>Summer 2019 - Ongoing: Lab Member</ins>
:   *[METU EEE Sensor Fusion Research Group](http://sensorfusion.eee.metu.edu.tr)*
:   *Supervisor: Assoc. Prof. Dr. Emre Ã–zkan*
:   I study statistical signal processing, with emphasis on particle filters. 
<!-- I am currently working on the problem of multiplying distributions approximated by a particle filter. -->

<ins>Summer 2019: Summer Intern in Research</ins>
:   *Karunya Institute of Technology and Sciences, Department of Instrumentation Engineering*
:   *Supervisors: Dr. M.S.P. Subathra & Dr. S. Thomas George*
:   Wanting to experience being part of a research project, I decided to go to a research internship (and an adventure) via IAESTE, and the project in KITS seemed interesting (although that's not the finalized project). I got to ask research questions with the help of my supervisors, and they helped me follow my own ideas based on the material I had, which produced [this paper](/publications/nr-lbp).

<ins>Summer 2018: Summer Intern</ins>
:   *IBM Turkey, Istanbul Office*
:   Observed on the field the process of data center migration. Helped the team in various tasks.

## Leadership and Teaching Experience

<ins>July 2021: Teaching Assistant</ins>
:   *[Neuromatch Academy](https://academy.neuromatch.io) Computational Neuroscience track, Tutorial TA*
:   Having enjoyed being an interactive student immensely the year before, I wanted to become a TA in NMA-CN. I was responsible for a pod in NMA-CN online summer school. I helped them go over tutorials about fundamental topics on computational neuroscience and develop a project, answered their questions about the coding exercises and the underlying theory.

<ins>Fall 2018 & Spring 2020: Part-Time Student Assistant</ins>
:   *METU Department of Mathematics*
:   I was the student assistant for the course MA153 Calculus for Mathematics Students I (Fall 2018) and MA154 Calculus for Mathematics Students II (Spring 2020); and I graded weekly assignments and provided feedback to students.

## Organizations, Trainings & Others

Summer 2020: Interactive Student in Neuromatch Academy
:   I participated in a 3-week long, intense summer school as an interactive student, which entailed preparing a project. In the project, we used linear models from scikit-learn Python library and worked on preprocessed fMRI data.

Fall 2019: Instructor for Mathematics Workshop at Ankara Tevfik Fikret Private High School

2019 - 2021: Coordinator in IAESTE LC METU
