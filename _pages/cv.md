## Professional Experience

<ins>February 2022 - Present: Research Assistant</ins>
:   *[Middle East Technical University](https://eee.metu.edu.tr/personel/ogul-yurdakul)*
:   Although the job title is "research assistant," it is a teaching assistantship position, meaning I will be TA for various courses, likely changing from semester to semester.
:   **Spring 2021-2022:** [EE230 Probability and Random Variables](https://catalog.metu.edu.tr/course.php?course_code=5670230) and (the updated) [EE306 Signals and Systems II](https://catalog.metu.edu.tr/course.php?course_code=5670306).
:   **Fall 2022-2023:** [EE361 Electromechanical Energy Conversion I](https://catalog.metu.edu.tr/course.php?course_code=5670361) and [EE415 Introduction to Medical Imaging](https://catalog.metu.edu.tr/course.php?course_code=5670415).

<ins>Summer 2019 - Present: Lab Member</ins>
:   *[METU EEE Sensor Fusion Research Group](http://sensorfusion.eee.metu.edu.tr)*
:   *Supervisor: Assoc. Prof. Dr. Emre Özkan*
:   I study statistical signal processing, with emphasis on particle filters, Chernoff fusion and extended target tracking.

<ins>Summer 2019: Summer Intern in Research</ins>
:   *Karunya Institute of Technology and Sciences, Department of Instrumentation Engineering*
:   *Supervisors: Dr. M.S.P. Subathra & Dr. S. Thomas George*
:   Wanting to experience being part of a research project, I decided to go to a research internship (and an adventure) via IAESTE, and the project in KITS seemed interesting (although that's not the finalized project). I got to ask research questions with the help of my supervisors, and they helped me follow my own ideas based on the material I had, which produced [this paper](/publications/nr-lbp).

<ins>Summer 2018: Summer Intern</ins>
:   *IBM Turkey, Istanbul Office*
:   This was my first ever internship, and I value that it was *not* in research but in industry. I didn't do anything noteworthy if you ask me (understandable, as I had just finished 2nd year so I didn't know much), but still I enjoyed my time there and learned some stuff, especially about working in an office/company environment. It helped me see what to look for in a company if I were ever to switch to working in the industry. 

## Leadership and Teaching Experience

<ins>July 2021: Teaching Assistant </ins>
:   *[Neuromatch Academy](https://academy.neuromatch.io) Computational Neuroscience track, Tutorial TA ([Certificate](/files/NMA_TA_Certificate.pdf))*
:   Having enjoyed being an interactive student immensely the year before, I wanted to become a TA in NMA-CN. I was responsible for a pod in NMA-CN online summer school. I helped them go over tutorials about fundamental topics on computational neuroscience and develop a project, answered their questions about the coding exercises and the underlying theory.
:   Here's a [Twitter thread on a funny incident](https://twitter.com/ogulyurdakul/status/1420058847289516035?s=20&t=EkKAiZHDh7fJ4JEoGzkDHg) I went through at the end of my TAship this year.

<ins>Fall 2018 & Spring 2020: Part-Time Student Assistant</ins>
:   *METU Department of Mathematics*
:   I was the student assistant for the course MA153 Calculus for Mathematics Students I (Fall 2018) and MA154 Calculus for Mathematics Students II (Spring 2020); and I graded weekly assignments and provided feedback to students.

## Organizations, Trainings & Others

<ins>2019 - 2021: Coordinator in IAESTE LC METU</ins>
:   I was responsible for the acquisition and organization of work offers from around Ankara for IAESTE LC METU, trained newcomers on company relations, and hosted the incoming interns.

<ins>Summer 2020: Interactive Student in Neuromatch Academy</ins>
:   I participated in a 3-week long, intense summer school as an interactive student, which entailed preparing a project. In the project, we used linear models from scikit-learn Python library and worked on preprocessed fMRI data. 
:   NMA became a cornerstone in defining my scientist-to-be, with its inclusivity and commitment to open science. At the end of these three weeks, I was already keen on remaining a part of NMA, somehow.

<ins>Fall 2019: Instructor for Mathematics Workshop</ins>
:   I was offered an opportunity to deliver a workshop on mathematics to a group of second-year at my high school Ankara Private Tevfik Fikret High School. More in [side gigs](/whatnot/2022/00/side_gigs/#maths-workshop).

<ins>05/2017 – 05/2018: Team Leader and Director of Communications for [TEDxMETUAnkara 2017 "Grand Illusions"](https://www.ted.com/tedx/events/25058)</ins>
:   I booked speakers and worked with them on their speeches and was responsible for the overall operations of the event. I also designed and managed [the event website](https://www.tedxmetuankara.com) on Wix. More in [side gigs](/whatnot/2022/00/side_gigs/#tedxmetuankara).

## Publications
I suppose a CV has to contain this section. So, for completeness sake, here is a list of publication(s, hopefully).
