## Aikido

I started practicing aikido in 2019 at [METU Aikido Society](https://www.odtuaikido.org/en/main-page/){:target="_blank"} under Utku Havuç, following the school of [Tamura Shihan](https://www.odtuaikido.org/en/tamura-sensei-en/){:target="_blank"} and his student [Nebi Vural Sensei](http://www.nebivural.com/){:target="_blank"}. Although at the time I couldn't practice as often as I wanted to, I started practicing regularly again starting with the pandemic (safely, of course, over Zoom using our weapons). Recently as the COVID-19 prohibitions are relaxed by the government, I have started practicing (actual physical training this time) at [Katsu Dojo](https://www.katsuankara.com/){:target="_blank"}, again under Utku Havuç.

## Translation

I am hesitant to call myself a "translator", but I think I can do so by calling myself an "*amateur* translator". I mostly translate English content to Turkish, although in the future I would like to translate works in French to Turkish, and translate Turkish content *to* English and French as well. 

- I am a volunteer TED translator with a couple of videos. You can find the videos I translated on my [TED profile](https://www.ted.com/profiles/6269142/translator){:target="_blank"}. 
- I with two other people have translated [this text](https://www.aikidodergisi.com/2021/09/12/jujutsu-judo-ve-aikido/){:target="_blank"} to Turkish. The text, titled "Jūjutsu, Jūdō and Aikidō" is an excerpt from Donald Frederick “Donn” Draeger's *Comprehensive Asian Fighting Arts* (8th edition, 1989).

## Maths Workshop

During the fall of 2019, a high school maths teacher of mine (whom I love very much, hi Başak Hocam!) approached me one day, with the idea of creating a workshop on mathematics for second-year high school students. It was going to be something to motivate them into really trying to really understand a subject rather than just memorizing facts and learning to solve templates of questions (the Turkish education system is not very good about this.). I accepted to be the one to deliver the workshop. I was responsible for its content and its delivery, and although my aim was to make it weekly, I could only do as often as my exam schedule permitted me. 

I tried to showcase some mathematical topic that I thought were foreign to them, and some basic interesting proofs (infinitude of primes). I tried to select topics they don't encounter in their regular high school curriculum, to "disarm" them of what they already know and to level the playing ground. I talked about 
- some basic linear algebra (the concept of span, linear independence and dimension), 
- some graph theory (Königsberg bridge problem and Eulerian paths), and 
- different types of infinities (countable vs. uncountable). 

At one point, I also found myself talking about 
- Fourier series representations of periodic signals (the question was why do different musical instruments make different noises if we say that they are producing the same note? If they are producing the same notes, what's the reason behind their different sounds?) 
- and, well, the continuum hypothesis (At one point one of the students went "I think I might *possibly* get this..." and that's plenty for me. Although, I have no doubt that I did a terrible job explaining the continuum hypothesis and what it means, because I keep on). 
The last two went as well as expected.

The two most valuable lessons I learned is that 
- me understanding a topic does not entail me being able to convey it, especially to second-year high school students with a dozen different (and honestly, unexpected) questions. 
- me wanting or being excited to talk about stuff *especially* does not make me good at explaining them. 

However, in the end, I learned a lot and had a lot of fun. We had to stop because of the pandemic at one point and so I couldn't cover as much ground as I wanted to. It's been quite some time since then, and recently I talked with the school to make the workshop online. I will certainly tread more carefully this time if I start doing the workshops again: It will take a lot more work and require a lot more planning, but I felt it was worth it in the end. 

## TEDxMETUAnkara

I booked speakers and worked with them on their speeches and was responsible for the overall operations of the event. I also designed and managed the event [website](https://www.tedxmetuankara.com){:target="_blank"} on Wix.
