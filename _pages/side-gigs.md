## Aikido

I started practicing aikido in 2019 at [METU Aikido Society](https://www.odtuaikido.org/en/main-page/){:target="_blank"} under Utku Havuç, following the school of [Tamura Shihan](https://www.odtuaikido.org/en/tamura-sensei-en/){:target="_blank"} and his student [Nebi Vural Sensei](http://www.nebivural.com/){:target="_blank"}. Although at the time I couldn't practice as often as I wanted to, I started practicing regularly again starting with the pandemic (safely, of course, over Zoom using our weapons). Recently as the COVID-19 prohibitions are relaxed by the government, I have started practicing (actual physical training this time) at [Katsu Dojo](https://www.katsuankara.com/){:target="_blank"}, again under Utku Havuç.

## Translation

I am hesitant to call myself a "translator", but I think I can do so by calling myself an "*amateur* translator". I mostly translate English content to Turkish, although in the future I would like to translate works in French to Turkish, and translate Turkish content *to* English and French as well. 

- I am a volunteer TED translator with a couple of videos. You can find the videos I translated on my [TED profile](https://www.ted.com/profiles/6269142/translator){:target="_blank"}. 
- I with two other people have translated [this text](https://www.aikidodergisi.com/2021/09/12/jujutsu-judo-ve-aikido/){:target="_blank"} to Turkish. The text, titled "Jūjutsu, Jūdō and Aikidō" is an excerpt from Donald Frederick “Donn” Draeger's *Comprehensive Asian Fighting Arts* (8th edition, 1989).

## TEDxMETUAnkara

I booked speakers and worked with them on their speeches and was responsible for the overall operations of the event. I also designed and managed the event [website](https://www.tedxmetuankara.com){:target="_blank"} on Wix.
