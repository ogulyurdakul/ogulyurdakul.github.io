You found my photo journal! Here I intend to share some pictures I take as I retake photography as a hobby. I took a photography course when I was in middle school, but life happened, and I, for some reason, did not take a camera in my hands for my own entertainment until now. I did some casual smartphone photography in the meantime, and I did enjoy it, but now I feel like I need to take this hobby a bit more seriously and invest some more time.

You can hover on the photos to see some explanation if there are any, and click on them to enlarge. If at any point you go *"Hey, that's me, but I don't want to be there!"* you can just tell me, and I'll remove the photo.

### 29.10.2021: *Alone at the office.*

I didn't really have much to do today, so I chose to do nothing at the office (even though I came to the office with ambitions to do stuff). I had taken my camera with me to force myself to take pictures and hey, I did. I can't help but think that the pictures I'm taking are ordinary and nothing but the ordinary, but I consider some of them to be photography exercises and some to hold some aesthetic because they're ordinary, so they end up here.

### 23.10.2021: *The second week of the photography course.*

I only have the first picture from the actual course, though, and the rest are from when I met with my friends. I mostly played with the depth of field, by choice and by force: Because we met late, I had to keep my aperture wide open, so I didn't have much depth. Taking pictures at night also meant that I also had to learn to steady my hand and crank up the ISO.

[<img src="/images/photoJournal/2021-10-23/vignette.jpg" width="120">](/images/photoJournal/2021-10-23/vignette.jpg "I have always liked compositions that are 'self-framed!, so I couldn't resist the urge to take this one when I saw it.")

[<img src="/images/photoJournal/2021-10-23/cheesecake.jpg" width="270">](/images/photoJournal/2021-10-23/cheesecake.jpg "Again, an attempt at using a shallow depth of field.")

### 17.10.2021: *The first day of the photography course.*

All the pictures were for learning how (auto)focusing works, so not much to show today (other than the ones I took at home).
