You found my photo journal! Here I intend to share some pictures I take, as I retake photography as a hobby. I took a photography course when I was in middle school, bu life happened and I for some reason did not take a camera in my hands for my own entertainment until now. I did some casual smartphone photography in the meantime, and I did enjoy it, but now I feel like I need to take this hobby a bit more seriously and invest some more time.

You can hover on the photos to see some explanation if there are any, and click on them to enlarge. If at any point you go *"Hey that's me, but I don't want to be there!"* you can just tell me and I'll remove the photo.

### 23.10.2021

The second week of the photography course. I only have the first picture from the actual course, though, and the rest are from when I met with my friends. I mostly played with the depth of field, by choice and by force: Because we met late I had to keep my aperture wide open so I didn't have much depth.

[<img src="/images/photoJournal/2021-10-23/vignette.jpg" width="120">](/images/photoJournal/2021-10-23/vignette.jpg "I have always liked compositions that are 'self-framed!, so I couldn't resist the urge to take this one when I saw it.")

[<img src="/images/photoJournal/2021-10-23/cheesecake.jpg" width="270">](/images/photoJournal/2021-10-23/cheesecake.jpg "Again, an attempt at using a shallow depth of field.")

### 17.10.2021

The first day of the photography course. All the pictures were for learning how (auto)focusing works, so not much to show today (other than the ones I took at home).

[<img src="/images/photoJournal/2021-10-17/ceil.jpg" width="270">](/images/photoJournal/2021-10-17/ceil.jpg "I took this one just to scratch my symmetry obsession, and it's the only one from the actual course.") 
[<img src="/images/photoJournal/2021-10-17/paw.jpg" width="270">](/images/photoJournal/2021-10-17/paw.jpg "Just a fluffy paw. I originally wanted to take a picture of him (Garavel, my cat) sleeping but the camera's autofocus noises startled him.") 
[<img src="/images/photoJournal/2021-10-17/garavel.jpg" width="270">](/images/photoJournal/2021-10-17/garavel.jpg "He's annoyed I woke him up.") 
[<img src="/images/photoJournal/2021-10-17/lampsym.jpg" width="120">](/images/photoJournal/2021-10-17/lampsym.jpg "Playing with the light (literally), the shadow (indirectly) and geometric patterns.")
