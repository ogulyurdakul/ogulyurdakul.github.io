You found my photo journal! Here I intend to share some pictures I take, as I retake photography as a hobby. I took a photography course when I was in middle school, bu life happened and I for some reason did not take a camera in my hands for my own entertainment until now. I did some casual smartphone photography in the meantime, and I did enjoy it, but now I feel like I need to take this hobby a bit more seriously and invest some more time.

You can hover on the photos to see some explanation if there are any, and click on them to enlarge.
