You found my photo journal! Here I intend to share some pictures I take as I retake photography as a hobby. I took a photography course when I was in middle school, but life happened, and I, for some reason, did not take a camera in my hands for my own enjoyment until I started attending this course on photography (see the first day). I did some casual smartphone photography in the meantime, and I did enjoy it, but now I feel like I need to take this hobby a bit more seriously and invest some more time.

Below you can see the Flickr albums for each posted day, and [click here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/ogulyurdakul/collections/72157720138555823/) to see a collection of my albums, formed with a more aesthetic motivation rather than chronological. If at any point you go *"Hey, that's me/mine, but I don't want (it) to be there!"* you can just tell me, and I'll remove the photo. It should also go without saying that **if you want to use a photograph I took for any reason, please do not do so without my consent.**

### 08.01.2022 *A late new year's eve.*

As the whole <abbr title="The group of people I practice aikido with.">dojo</abbr> we had planned a new year's party but it had to be cancelled due to multiple people getting the COVID (one of which was me), so we postponed it to January, and these are from that night. That night wass my first one out after my lovely COVID quarantine, <abbr title="The introvert in me was delighted.">which also wonderfully covered the new year's eve as well</abbr>. I was quite trigger happy, and took lots and lots of pictures, which I love. They are not here, however, because I had to make a distinction between pictures I love because I associate them with good memories and good people, and pictures I love because they are "objectively" good (whatever that means). The ones here are again somewhat (but not quite) in line with my minimal-but-strategic lighting goal, especially Borrowed drinks 1, so I am quite content with them.

### 10.12.2021 *Out after a long time.*

This day was the birthday of Anisa, a close friend of mine, and I decided to take my camera with me in hopes of capturing a couple of shots. It had been quite a long time since I last went out to shoot (as also evident by the dates I suppose) so I was quite eager to do so, but I also didn't want to sabotage Anisa's birthday.

On the other hand, I feel like the two pictures of Elif I took this day are really good examples of the kind of photos I want to take: There is very little light, especially on the subject, and it happens to be shining in very strategic ways so that it is just enough to show the subject, and not much more. Elif is almost not even illuminated at all, the background is much more luminous, but the light on her is just enough to show her face and her expressions.

### 07.11.2021 *The last week of the photography course, Sunday.*

Today was the only day I could join an actual outdoor photo shoot with the course, and I think it shows. I took many pictures, and these are what I salvage among them. We did practice under a theme given by Serhat Hoca, our instructor, a couple of times (like working with reflections) and that was a lot of fun. There's one thing Serhat Hoca said I will try to keep in mind in the future about working with reflections, and that's to not treat a reflective surface like a fancy physical image filter.

### 06.11.2021 *The last week of the photography course, Saturday.*

We were supposed to go on a photo shoot today but we didn't due to the cold weather and decided to make the next day's shoot longer. These are just some random pictures I took that day, so there is not much to show.

### 30-31.10.2021 *The third week of the photography course.*

On Saturday I was keen on going to the book fair and taking pictures, but it was *incredibly* crowded and so I just decided to get out of there after 30 minutes of idly looking at the booking. And I actually would have taken more pictures Sunday, but near the end of the course I felt sick and had to go home and rest. Serhat Hoca was showing such cool stuff too I'm so pissed...

### 29.10.2021: *Alone at the office.*

I didn't really have much to do today, so I chose to do nothing at the office (even though I came to the office with ambitions to do stuff). I had taken my camera with me to force myself to take pictures and hey, I did. I can't help but think that the pictures I'm taking are ordinary and nothing but the ordinary, but I consider some of them to be photography exercises and some to hold some aesthetic because they're ordinary, so they end up here.

### 23.10.2021: *The second week of the photography course.*

I only have the first picture from the actual course, though, and the rest are from when I met with my friends. I mostly played with the depth of field, by choice and by force: Because we met late, I had to keep my aperture wide open, so I didn't have much depth. Taking pictures at night also meant that I also had to learn to steady my hand and crank up the ISO.

### 17.10.2021: *The first week of the photography course.*

All the pictures were for learning how (auto)focusing works, so not much to show today (other than the ones I took at home).
