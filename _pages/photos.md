You found my photo journal! Here I intend to share some pictures I take as I retake photography as a hobby. I took a photography course when I was in middle school, but life happened, and I, for some reason, did not take a camera in my hands for my own enjoyment until I started attending this course on photography (see the first day). I did some casual smartphone photography in the meantime, and I did enjoy it, but now I feel like I need to take this hobby a bit more seriously and invest some more time.

You can hover on the photos to see some explanation if there are any, and click on them to enlarge. If at any point you go *"Hey, that's me/mine, but I don't want (it) to be there!"* you can just tell me, and I'll remove the photo.

### 07.11.2021 *The last week of the photography course, Sunday.*

### 06.11.2021 *The last week of the photography course, Saturday.*

We were supposed to go on a photo shoot today but we didn't due to the cold weather and decided to make the next day's shoot longer. These are just some random pictures I took that day, so there is not much to show.

[<img src="/images/photoJournal/2021-11-06/crazycat.jpg" width="270">](/images/photoJournal/2021-11-06/crazycat.jpg "This cat is just the most random thing I will remember about the photography course. His main thing is to meow extremely loudly every 30 seconds, for no reason at all, and then scuttle away every second time you try to pet it. There was just no making sense of it, and I love it.") 
[<img src="/images/photoJournal/2021-11-06/proof.jpg" width="120">](/images/photoJournal/2021-11-06/proof.jpg "I had to take this one, I just had to. I'll take a look at it whenever I'm having trouble with a proof, and make myself another cup of coffee. (Credit: I think the sign belongs to Arabica Coffee House.)") 


### 30-31.10.2021 *The third week of the photography course.*

On Saturday I was keen on going to the book fair and taking pictures, but it was *incredibly* crowded and so I just decided to get out of there after 30 minutes of idly looking at the booking. And I actually would have taken more pictures Sunday, but near the end of the course I felt sick and had to go home and rest. Serhat Hoca was showing such cool stuff too I'm so pissed...

### 29.10.2021: *Alone at the office.*

I didn't really have much to do today, so I chose to do nothing at the office (even though I came to the office with ambitions to do stuff). I had taken my camera with me to force myself to take pictures and hey, I did. I can't help but think that the pictures I'm taking are ordinary and nothing but the ordinary, but I consider some of them to be photography exercises and some to hold some aesthetic because they're ordinary, so they end up here.

### 23.10.2021: *The second week of the photography course.*

I only have the first picture from the actual course, though, and the rest are from when I met with my friends. I mostly played with the depth of field, by choice and by force: Because we met late, I had to keep my aperture wide open, so I didn't have much depth. Taking pictures at night also meant that I also had to learn to steady my hand and crank up the ISO.

[<img src="/images/photoJournal/2021-10-23/mug.jpg" width="270">](/images/photoJournal/2021-10-23/mug.jpg "The only one I took at the course. I liked how the frame was black-and-white by itself, and also the narrow depth of field (yup that's it).") 
[<img src="/images/photoJournal/2021-10-23/vignette.jpg" width="120">](/images/photoJournal/2021-10-23/vignette.jpg "I have always liked compositions that are 'self-framed!, so I couldn't resist the urge to take this one when I saw it.") 
[<img src="/images/photoJournal/2021-10-23/kutay.jpg" width="120">](/images/photoJournal/2021-10-23/kutay.jpg "Kutay. I forgot to adjust the WB in all the next pictures, so they were too orange to begin with, and I had to fix it afterwards.")

[<img src="/images/photoJournal/2021-10-23/cheesecake.jpg" width="270">](/images/photoJournal/2021-10-23/cheesecake.jpg "Again, an attempt at using a shallow depth of field.") 
[<img src="/images/photoJournal/2021-10-23/berfin.jpg" width="270">](/images/photoJournal/2021-10-23/berfin.jpg "Berfin. I didn't fix the colors of this one because she looks like she's sipping a cup in front of a fire, and I liked that.") 
[<img src="/images/photoJournal/2021-10-23/gunes.jpg" width="270">](/images/photoJournal/2021-10-23/gunes.jpg "Güneş. I wish I had taken this properly without the blur, it would have been a much better photo.") 

### 17.10.2021: *The first week of the photography course.*

All the pictures were for learning how (auto)focusing works, so not much to show today (other than the ones I took at home).

[<img src="/images/photoJournal/2021-10-17/ceil.jpg" width="270">](/images/photoJournal/2021-10-17/ceil.jpg "I took this one just to scratch my symmetry obsession, and it's the only one from the actual course.") 
[<img src="/images/photoJournal/2021-10-17/paw.jpg" width="270">](/images/photoJournal/2021-10-17/paw.jpg "Just a fluffy paw. I originally wanted to take a picture of him (Garavel, my cat) sleeping but the camera's autofocus noises startled him.") 
[<img src="/images/photoJournal/2021-10-17/garavel.jpg" width="270">](/images/photoJournal/2021-10-17/garavel.jpg "He's annoyed I woke him up.") 
[<img src="/images/photoJournal/2021-10-17/lampsym.jpg" width="120">](/images/photoJournal/2021-10-17/lampsym.jpg "Playing with the light (literally), the shadow (indirectly) and geometric patterns.")
