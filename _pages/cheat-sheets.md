Over the years, I've developed the habit of writing out "cheat sheets" when studying for each course. I prepared them throughout the semester, to keep track of what I have learned so far in the course. They consist of the knowledge I thought was essential for the course, starting with the basic definitions and moving on to the more complex and composite facts and theorems. At first I was writing them on paper, but then I moved onto writing them in LaTeX because I thought it made them more legible an structured (also I *really* needed something to do during quarantine. I know, I'm fun like that.). You can find the ones in LaTeX below, and I plan to share the others as I type them out.

*If you find a typo, or more dangerously so outright false information, please reach out to me at [yurdakul.ogulcan@gmail.com](mailto:yurdakul.ogulcan@gmail.com) and I will fix the document as quickly as I can.*
