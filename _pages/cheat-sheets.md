Over the years, I've developed the habit of writing out "cheat sheets" when studying for each course. I prepared them throughout the semester to keep track of what I have learned so far in the course. They consist of the knowledge I thought was essential, starting with the basic definitions and moving on to the more complex and composite facts and theorems, omitting their proofs if I don't think they are essential knowledge. At first, I was writing them on paper, but then I moved on to writing them in LaTeX because I thought it made them more legible and structured (also I *really* needed something to do during quarantine. I know, I'm fun like that.). You can find the ones in LaTeX below, and I plan to share the others as I type them out.

## General

- [Living With MATLAB](/matlab) is a somewhat advanced MATLAB tutorial that first points to some elementary resources, then illustrates some good coding and report writing practices in the MATLAB environment. The final section is targeted for statistical and probabilistic calculations in MATLAB.

## Electrical and Electronics Engineering

- [EE302 Feedback Systems (Spring 2018-2019)](/files/EE302CheatSheet_OgulCanYurdakul.pdf){:target="_blank"} (Hand-written)
- [EE416 Biomedical Signals, Instrumentation and Measurement (Spring 2019-2020)](/files/EE416CheatSheet_OgulCanYurdakul.pdf){:target="_blank"} (This one has some missing parts but I believe it still covers quite some ground, so I think it's good to share.)
- [EE5506 Advanced Statistical Signal Processing (Spring 2021-2022)](/files/EE5506CheatSheet_OgulCanYurdakul.pdf){:target="_blank"}
